# Vrün FAQ

<MarkdownToDisclosure>
## What is Ethereum Staking?

Ethereum staking involves locking up your ETH to support network operations such as transaction validation and network security. In return, you earn rewards.

## How do Staking Rewards Work?

Staking rewards are earned through attestations (validating transactions) and proposals (proposing new blocks). Both activities help secure the network and keep it decentralized.

## What are the Risks of Staking?

The primary risk of staking is slashing, where a portion of your staked ETH can be taken away if your validator acts maliciously or makes significant errors.

## What is Rocket Pool?

Rocket Pool is a permissionless Ethereum staking protocol catering to both ETH Stakers and Node Operators. It allows users to stake ETH with as little as 0.01 ETH and receive rETH, a liquid staking derivative token. Node operators can run validators with reduced collateral requirements, benefiting from additional commission and RPL rewards.

## What are the Risks of Using Rocket Pool?

In addition to general staking risks, using Rocket Pool introduces protocol risk, which includes potential vulnerabilities or bugs within the Rocket Pool protocol that could affect stakers.

## What is Vrün?

Vrün is a service for Rocket Pool Node Operators, enabling them to run Rocket Pool nodes without having to set up or manage their own hardware. We provide a secure, non-custodial, and user-friendly staking experience for Node Operators.

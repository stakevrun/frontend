# Terms and conditions
Thank you for visiting Vrün, a digital platform operated by and proprietary to Vrün Ltd (company number 15788936).

By engaging Vrün (including by sending signed instructions), you agree to be legally bound by these terms and conditions as a "client".

## 1. Legally binding and compliant

1. You represent and affirm that you have the legal capacity to enter into and be bound by these terms and conditions in their entirety.
2. Your conduct is subject to the laws, regulations and rules of any applicable governmental or regulatory authority (the "Applicable Laws and Regulations) and you agree and acknowledge to act in compliance with the Applicable Laws and Regulations.
3. You acknowledge and agree that these terms and conditions may change from time to time, and that by continuing to engage Vrün (including by sending signed instructions), you agree to be legally bound by the latest version of these terms and conditions as available at vrün.com.

## 2. Who is a client?
A client is:
 1. an Ethereum address
 2. that has sent one or more signed instructions to Vrün
 3. that has deposited funds into [fee account] for the purpose of paying Vrün the relevant Service Fees.

## 3. What Vrün does and does not do

1. Vrün will use commercially reasonable endeavours to run Ethereum validators on behalf of its clients. 
2. You may request Vrun to perform the following by sending signed instructions:
    1. create a new validator key that can be deposited on the Ethereum network
    2. enable duties that Vrün should perform in respect of a validator
    3. set the "graffiti" to include with Ethereum blocks proposed by a validator
    4. retrieve the cryptographic data required to exit an existing validator.
    5. anything else reasonably requested, provided that the instruction does not conflict with the Applicable Laws and Regulations or the Ethereum blockchain's consensus mechanism.
3. Vrün will only perform its duties to the extent it has been paid its Service Fees. You acknowledge and agree that Vrün may fail to follow your instructions and/or perform duties for your validators if you have not prepaid its Service Fees.
4. Vrün will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all signed instructions provided by clients. However, running validators carries potential risks. Importantly,
    1. Vrün will not be responsible to you for downtime or inactivity, and you agree and acknowledge that this may result in missed rewards and inactivity penalties
    2. While Vrün will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any staked assets from "slashing" (penalties imposed by the Ethereum network if a transaction validator representing assets incorrectly validates a transaction or commits some other error), Vrün will not be responsible for or liable to you for any slashing penalty.

## 4. Service Fees
1. To use Vrün’s services, you must prepay the applicable Service Fees, as set out on stakevrun.com/pricing. 
2. Service Fees will be deducted from your [fee account] each day that Vrün runs a validator for you.

## 5. Disputes
1. In the event of any dispute or problem arising out of, or in connection with, the use of Vrün’s services, please contact Vrün by providing signed instructions via its website or via its public Discord. You should clearly indicate that you are raising a complaint (rather than a query).
2. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these terms and conditions, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the London Court of International Arbitration Rules, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause.

    The number of arbitrators shall be determined by agreement, or failing that, three.
   
    The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be London, UK. 

    The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. 

    The governing law of the contract shall be the substantive law of England and Wales.

## 6. Disclaimer of liability
1. You agree and acknowledge that Vrün is not responsible for any funds you provide to or through Vrün. Vrün does not intend to hold client funds at any time. Clients will deposit their "stake" directly to Ethereum via Rocket Pool. Client's "stakes" will be returned directly to the withdrawal address specified by client via signed instructions.
2. You agree and understand that you will not make Vrün a party to any dispute involving a third party. You further agree and understand that Vrün is not responsible for your use (or misuse) of any validator and that you will not make Vrün a party to any dispute involving your use (or misuse) of any validator. In any event, you hereby agree to indemnify Vrün for any and all costs, including legal costs, which are reasonably incurred by Vrün and related to any such disputes.
3. You agree and understand that Vrün is providing its services on a best efforts basis, subject to these terms and conditions, and will not be responsible to you for any loss or damages suffered as a result any errors or bugs that may exist in our interfaces (including our web frontend and web API).

## 7. Indemnity
In no event shall Vrün be liable for any act, omission, error of judgment, or loss suffered by you in connection with these terms and conditions or your use or attempted use of Vrün or Vrün's running of validators. You agree to indemnify and hold Vrün harmless from or against any or all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), claims, disbursements or actions of any kind and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of Vrün, any validator run by Vrün, or Vrün's performance, nonperformance or negligence in performance of its duties to you.

## 8. Legal costs
You agree to indemnify Vrün for actual, reasonable legal costs and expenses directly related to your account or any related account that are a result of any regulatory inquiry, legal action, litigation, dispute, or investigation whether such situations occur or are anticipated, that arise or relate to you or your use of Vrün. As a result, we will be entitled to charge your [fee account] for such costs without notice, including legal and enforcement related costs that we incur. Any withholding will last for a period of time that is reasonably necessary to resolve any regulatory or legal issue at hand, and we may place any amounts garnered from you in a separate account, and will pay you the remaining balance after any noted issue has been resolved. Furthermore, you agree that where such anticipated or actual actions relate to a specific asset in your account, that asset may not be transferred out of said account until the matter is resolved. We will provide copies of all invoices on request.

## 9. Governing law
These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of England and Wales and subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.
